# Layla-wheel
Layla-wheel is a website created with React. It allows you to make decisions with our wheel. You can add multiple items into the wheel. The wheel spins and lands on one of the entered items. 
It saves your items in your localstorage so you get your entered data back.

## How it works
On the rightside of the Website you can see a table with the last picks from the wheel. There are none when its the first time spinning. You can add textboxes with the "+" to enter more items. By pressing "Add Entries" the data will import to the wheel which you can spin by clicking on it. The winner will be stored in the "Last picked" List.
